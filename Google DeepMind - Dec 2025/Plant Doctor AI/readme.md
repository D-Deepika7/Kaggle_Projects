# 🌱Plant Doctor AI — Smarter Plant Health Assistant Powered by Gemini 3 Pro
## Diagnose plant diseases instantly using multimodal intelligence

Plant Doctor AI is an intelligent plant-care assistant built with Gemini 3 Pro’s multimodal reasoning to help gardeners, farmers, and hobbyists quickly diagnose plant health issues using just a photo and a few optional details. It aims to make agricultural and home-garden support accessible, accurate, and easy for everyone, regardless of expertise.

Users upload an image of a plant leaf, stem, or fruit, and Gemini 3 Pro analyzes the visual features to detect diseases, nutrient deficiencies, pests, growth issues, or anomalies. To improve diagnostic precision, the app also accepts optional text inputs, such as plant name (local/regional synonyms included), estimated age, and observed symptoms.

The output provides a quick summary (plant name, health status, severity level) followed by a detailed explanation and personalized care recommendations. The app further enhances user experience with:

- Recent history (last 5 uploads)
- Feedback-based accuracy tracking using thumbs up/down
- A text-based Q&A section for plant-care questions
- A friendly, nature-themed UI with soft illustrations and a custom leaf cursor
- Clear safety & accuracy notes ensuring responsible usage

By combining Gemini’s native image understanding, long-context reasoning, and natural conversation, Plant Doctor AI empowers individuals to care for their plants confidently while reducing crop losses and supporting sustainable practices.

You can try the full interactive experience in the public AI Studio app and explore the demo video that showcases real-time diagnosis and user interaction.
